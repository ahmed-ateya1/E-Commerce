# E-Commerce.API

## Overview
E-Commerce.API is a full-featured backend application designed for an online shopping platform. It provides APIs to manage user accounts, products, orders, payments, and more. The application leverages a clean architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and testability.

---

## Technologies Used

### Backend Framework
- **ASP.NET Core 9.0**: Used to build RESTful APIs and provide middleware for handling HTTP requests.

### Database
- **Entity Framework Core**: An Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for data access and management.
- **SQL Server**: The relational database used for storing data.

### Payment Gateway
- **Stripe**: Integrated for payment processing, including payment intents and refunds.

### Authentication and Authorization
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for secure user authentication.

### Caching
- **MemoryCache**: For in-memory caching of frequently accessed data.

### Logging
- **Serilog**: For structured and file-based logging.

### Others
- **AutoMapper**: For mapping between DTOs and entities.
- **SignalR**: For real-time application features such as notifications.
- **Swagger**: For API documentation.
- **Fluent Validation**: Provides fluent validation for defining model validation.

---

## Project Architecture

The project follows a clean architecture approach, separating concerns into multiple layers:

### 1. **Controllers**
   - Handle HTTP requests and responses.
   - Validate user inputs and interact with services.

### 2. **Core Layer**
   - Contains business logic, services, and contracts.
   - Includes caching, domain models, DTOs, and helpers.

### 3. **Services**
   - Business logic for various features such as payments, orders, and product management.

### 4. **Repository Pattern**
   - Provides data access logic via a unit of work and repositories.

### 5. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**
   - Separates commands (write operations) and queries (read operations) to improve scalability and maintainability.
   - Commands handle updates, inserts, and deletions, while queries handle data retrieval.

### 6. **Generic Repository**
   - Implements a generic approach for data access, reducing code duplication.
   - Provides CRUD operations for all entities, making the repository reusable and extensible.

### 7. **Unit of Work**
   - Manages transactions across multiple repositories, ensuring consistency.
   - Simplifies data operations by grouping multiple changes into a single transaction.

## Docker Support

The application is containerized using Docker, making it easy to set up and run in any environment.

### Prerequisites
- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your machine.

### Steps to Run the Application with Docker

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmed-ateya1/E-Commerce.git
   cd E-Commerce
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image**
   ```bash
   docker build -t e-commerce-api .
   ```

3. **Run the Docker Container**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 5000:80 e-commerce-api
   ```

4. **Access the Application**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.
   - Use Swagger UI at `http://localhost:5000/swagger` to explore the API endpoints.

### Docker Compose (Optional)
If you want to run the application along with a SQL Server database, use Docker Compose:

1. **Create a `docker-compose.yml` File**
   ```yaml
   version: '3.8'
   services:
     db:
       image: mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest
       environment:
         SA_PASSWORD: "YourStrong!Passw0rd"
         ACCEPT_EULA: "Y"
       ports:
         - "1433:1433"
     app:
       build: .
       ports:
         - "5000:80"
       depends_on:
         - db
   ```

2. **Run Docker Compose**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
